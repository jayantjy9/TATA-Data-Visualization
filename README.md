# 🚀 Virtual Internship - Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights 📊

This repository documents my completion of a virtual internship as a data consultant for an online retail store. Throughout the internship, I worked on various tasks aimed at providing valuable insights to the CEO and CMO of the business. Below is an overview of the tasks I completed:
<br><br>

## 📋 Task Overview

### Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario 🎯

In this task, I anticipated the questions that would be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. By understanding the different perspectives of these business leaders, I created a set of four differentiated questions that they would ask and seek answers to. These questions served as a guide for further analysis and presentation development.

### Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals 📈🔍

Understanding the requirements from the CEO and CMO, I carefully selected the most effective visuals for each scenario. By considering the type of information being presented and the desired insights, I ensured that the chosen visuals accurately illustrated the data and effectively conveyed the desired message.

### Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals 🖼️📊

Based on the four questions posed by the CEO and CMO, I created visuals that addressed their specific needs.

**Question 1**

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

**Question 2**

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

**Question 3**

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

**Question 4**

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

### Task 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis 🗣️💡

In this final task, I developed a script and recorded a video presentation to effectively communicate my findings to the CEO and CMO. The script covered the entire data analysis process, including data loading, cleaning, and the steps taken to ensure error-free analysis. The focus was on providing the most important and relevant information to the business leaders.
